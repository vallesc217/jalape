Create Customized Product Add-Ons for WooCommerce Products to Expand Product Options for the Customer.
== Description ==

Use Product Add-Ons to enhance the WooCommerce Product Functionality. Create and sell more advanced products by adding unlimited customized add-on options to your WooCommerce Store Products. If Simple or Variable Products won’t provide the flexibility of options you need to sell your products, Product Add-ons Plugin is the best choice to fulfill your company’s needs.

You have the flexibility to assign Add-Ons to only a select Product, select Category or a selection of both Products and Categories. You can also apply a Product Add-on to All Products in your WooCommerce Store with one click. Depending on your Add-ons you can choose which display style best fits your product requirements. The Product Add-on can be shown to the customer by: Checkbox, Radio Button, Selection or Text Field.

Product Add-ons works for obvious Add-ons like adding an option for free or paid toppings on your hamburger or for more complex use-cases like the following example: You have an apparel WooCommerce store selling T-shirts. You create a product, Graphic Tee, as a Variable Product with sizes: S, M, L, and XL. You can use Product Add-ons to allow the customer to add custom Text to the shirt, OR select a different Graphic image, OR Color of the Shirt. Product Add-ons can also include pricing options! You can decide to sell the Yellow t-shirt for a higher price than the White t-shirt selection. The possibilities are endless to use Product Add-ons to customize what the customer can add to your product and/or upsell with Add-Ons options. Even save time by using Add-ons to help optimize your custom T-shirt company avoiding back and forth after purchase logistics, streamlining your operations!
